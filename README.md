Snake: Spectrum
The Classic Reimagined. Smoother. Faster. Infinite.

Rediscover the arcade classic like never before. Snake: Spectrum combines nostalgic gameplay with ultra-modern visuals, silky-smooth 60 FPS fluid movement, and a massive 120-level campaign. Forget the clunky grid movement of the past—this snake moves with organic precision.

🐍 Features
🌟 120 Unique Levels Embark on a massive campaign spanning 12 distinct world themes. Start in the open void, navigate the tricky Checkerboards, survive the tight Corridors, and master the chaotic Spectrum levels.

✨ Ultra-Smooth "Tube" Engine Experience our custom-built rendering engine. The snake isn't just a chain of squares—it's a continuous, organic vector tube that glides effortlessly across the screen with zero lag.

⚔️ Power-Ups & Perils Strategy meets reflexes.

Magnet (🧲): Automatically suck in nearby apples for 10 seconds.

Shield (🛡️): Survive a fatal crash!

Skulls (💀): Watch out! Eating one instantly costs you a life.

Poison (🧪): Reverses your controls—can you handle the confusion?

❤️ Second Chance Mechanics Don't lose your progress! You have 3 Lives. Crashing into a wall doesn't reset your length immediately—you respawn coiled and ready to keep your high score streak alive until your lives run out.
